# setbpp
A small windows utility I wrote in C++ back when I had to regularly set 100+ workstations with 4 to 8 monitors each to 16-bit colordepth, that's 7 clicks per monitor on Windows 7.
# Usage
Just run as part of a script or at startup, there's deliberitely no feedback (except the screen color-depth change).
